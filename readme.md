# Academy of Natural Sciences Vertebrate Paleontology Lab

This is a repository for ANSP Vertebrate Paleontology database and lab. Intended for use by lab volunteers and co-op students entering data for Vertebrate Paleontology. It was written during my co-op at the Academy as a student at Drexel University.

The file database.md is a description of our database schema in Filemaker and how we map those records to Darwin Core standards.

The file dig_workflows.md will be a description for our digitization workflows and how we are sharing our collections online through resources like iDigBio and PaleoBioDB

The proposed website for the lab is currently hosted on the gh-pages branch and can be viewed directly at [https://vincentoleary.github.io/ANSP/](https://vincentoleary.github.io/ANSP/)

Other files for our website and UUID system will be added as well. Check back soon!
